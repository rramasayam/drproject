NEW FEATURE CHANGE
We'd like you to establish a GitHub account to facilitate hands-on practice 
of the network flow components of Git during class. A free account can be 
established at the GitHub Signup Page. We also recommend that you take a 
look at our supported browsers after you signup to ensure the best experience.

Please keep your username and password close at hand. You'll use it several times during class.

It is the best if you use any valid good valid email address for your GitHub.com 
signup at which you can receive email during class. Demonstrations of code comments 
and Pull Requests work best when you can see them functioning end to end, including email-based notifications
